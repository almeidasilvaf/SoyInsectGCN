Description: This is a Shiny app to explore a gene coexpression network
    inferred from RNA-seq data of soybean tissues infested with
    insects and nematodes. Users can input a gene ID and explore its degree, 
    hub status, module, and module's enriched pathways and biological processes.
    A network plot is also displayed for each module, with the input gene
    highlighted.
